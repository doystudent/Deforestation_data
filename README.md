# Deforestation_data
These graphs illustrate the relationship between population growth and deforestation in Brazil, focusing specifically on the state of Amazonas. Figure1 shows the amount of deforestation, measured in kmÂ², while Figure2 displays the population size for each corresponding year. The data reveal a positive correlation: as the population size increases, the rate of deforestation also increases. These findings suggest that population growth may be a contributing factor to deforestation in the Amazonas region.
